# Project

The goal of this project was to make a mini digital edition of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein manuscript which also contains edits made by her husband, Percy B. Shelley. The manuscript was digitized along with the edits, and an attempt was made to make the digital edition interactive such that the users can view various edits, hide them, see who made the edit; Mary Shelley or Percy B. Shelley and also read the manuscript without viewing the edits.

Various files have been organized into folders. Following is a list of the folders and what they contain:

1. XML  	  -> contains XML files for the individual pages that were annotated according to TEI XML guidelines available on BDMP website.
2. XSL  	  -> contains the XSL sheets that transformed the XML elements into HTML elements. It has 2 files, one containing transformations for the meta data and one to transform the text on the individual pages.
3. HTML 	  -> contains the HTML code for the index page and individual pages 
4. CSS  	  -> contains the css file which has code to style the various elements of the HTML page and help visualize them.
5. JavaScript -> contains a javascript file with code for various buttons on the pages and how the function when interacted with.
